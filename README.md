# Linear Regression Training Project: Ecommerce Clients

## What is the objective of the project?
This is a training project. This means that the data is not real and the project is for education purposes only. We suppose that a company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We are here to help them make a data-driven decision.

## What is the data in the project ?
In this project we work with a dataset [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav/ecommerce-customer-device-usage). The data includes information about customers of an e-commerce website, including the following:
- Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
- Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
- Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
- Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
Note that all the personal information is not real.
